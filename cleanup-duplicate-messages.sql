-- SQL-like script to clean up duplicate welcome messages
-- This is a reference for manual cleanup if needed
-- 1. Find all welcome messages in a session:
-- Query: messages collection where sessionId = "your-session-id" and text contains "ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Transaction Chat"
-- 2. Keep only the earliest one (by timestamp) and delete the rest
-- 3. For your current session with duplicates, you can:
--    a) Go to Firebase Console > Firestore > messages collection
--    b) Filter by sessionId = "qt8ugXgVsjR9sVINF86W" (or your current session)
--    c) Look for documents with text containing "ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Transaction Chat"
--    d) Delete all but the earliest one (keep the one with earliest timestamp)
-- Example of duplicate IDs from your data:

-- After cleanup, your session should only have one welcome message at the beginning
